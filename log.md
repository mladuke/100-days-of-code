### Day 2: August  02, 2018 

**Thoughts:

     Worked on Path of Exile Python Script
	
	1) It takes the output of Path of Building (xml file) and parses the data
	
	2) not treating the file as xml, but as test.  Should see how to parse xml content
	
	3) Need to output some of the additions to a text file rather than just to the screen.
	
	4) Still need to investigate using data dirrectly from from Path of Exile to look at stash.

	Now What.  Not sure what is going on so time to watch https://www.coursera.org/learn/intro-sql

    After fighting with the mysql password, finally was able to open up phpmyadmin.
    
    https://linuxconfig.org/how-to-reset-root-mysql-password-on-ubuntu-18-04-bionic-beaver-linux was how I did it.
    
    Added a table and ran a simple query. Will do more complex things soon.
